We did not need this level of granularity and decided to average the readings every hour.  Theoretically, this would reduce our data by a factor of about 3600.

The first line in the file becomes the start time rounded to the nearest half hour rounded down (ex 4:15 would have a start time at 3:30 and 4:45 would have a start time of 4:30) and the end time is the start time plus one hour.  A dictionary of values with the parameter, subsensor, and system as the key and the total for each as the values was then created.  Once the timestamp is greater than the end time or there are no more lines in the file to read, the thread takes the mean value for each key and appends it to a new csv file with the node id.  The values are cleared and the thread continues if there are more values in the file or moves on to the next file.  The entire process takes about 30 minutes to run, and we were able to reduce the size of the entire dataset from 300 GB down to 1.8 GB.

A sparse matrix for each node with the sensor types as the values was used.  The sensor types were limited to only the subsystem types that include air quality metrics.  The dendrogram below was produced using agglomerative clustering with a distance threshold of 15.  There is clear separation between the groups meaning that there are differences in the types of data collected at these nodes.  From the bar chart, we can see that there is a cluster group that does not have any of the air quality data that we are most concerned with.  The other two groups have all of them and appear to have good coverage around the city as shown in the map.\"\"\"\n",

The most reliable results came from the Agglomerative clustering with the date averaging data representation.  It appears that there are differences in the cluster groups that are clear in the average time series for each cluster.  It is not clear, however, how these groups were separated.  In the map, we can see that most of the nodes belong to a single cluster.  The second largest cluster, shown in blue, appears to be much noisier than the largest orange group.  The smallest clusters appear to be the least consistent sensors and have many data gaps or were only active for a short period of time. It appears that the clusters may have only separated based on measurement consistency.  Further analysis is required to understand why these nodes are producing noisier data.  It is unclear if this is due to a faulty sensor or if there are local sources of pollution that cause the spikes.  Future projects could compare these clusters to traffic patterns and industrial centers that could be producers.  It would also be beneficial to include more variables such as wind speed and direction that have an impact on the direction of pollution plume movement.  \"\"\"\n",
